      I made this webpage in order to present my work to the world. It is currently a work in progress.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a PhD student at the University of Washington Computer Science Department. My focus in on computational fabrication of mechanical metamaterials with stochastic or regular connectivity. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my academic homepage. I got my undergraduate degree from Texas A&amp;M University in Electrical Engineering in 2012. I then worked full-time at the Georgia Tech Research Institute as a research engineer for high-powered radar systems. Simultaneously, I completed my master's degree in Electrical Engineering by creating a one-tool, hybrid-manufacturing approach to fabricating planar radio frequency structures. I then took a job at Texas Instruments where I was the principle engineer applying inkjet printing technology to wafer level packaging solutions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to academic life in 2019 after working at Texas Instruments. In my time working with 3D printing (aka additive manufacturing aka digital fabrication) I felt that software was the limiting factor in unlocking the full capabilities. This began my search for a PhD program where I could apply my hardware/fabrication background toward an application of enhancing people's abilities to design complicated and intricate objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the University of Washington I am focused on fabrication and simulation of mechanical metamaterials. My work spans planar materials as well as three dimensional stochastic foam-like materials. I apply mathematics and physical simulation techniques to turn the intractable space of metamaterial design into an intutive and accessible design space.
