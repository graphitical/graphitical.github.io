      I am a PhD student at the University of Washington Computer Science Department, where I am focused on
      computational fabrication and physical simulation. I specialize in the mechanics of metamaterials and discrete
      elastic rod (DER) simulation.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a PhD student at the University of Washington Computer Science Department. My focus in on computational
      fabrication of mechanical metamaterials with stochastic or regular connectivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my academic homepage. I received my undergraduate degree from Texas A&amp;M University in Electrical
      Engineering in 2012. I then worked full-time at the Georgia Tech Research Institute as a research engineer designing 
      high-power radar systems. Simultaneously, I completed my master's degree in Electrical Engineering by creating a
      one-tool, hybrid-manufacturing approach to fabricating planar radio frequency structures. I then took a job at
      Texas Instruments where I was the principle engineer applying inkjet printing technology to wafer level packaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to academic life in 2019 after working at Texas Instruments. In my time working with 3D printing (aka
      additive manufacturing aka digital fabrication) I felt that software was the limiting factor in unlocking the full
      capabilities. This began my search for a PhD program where I could apply my hardware/fabrication background toward
      an application of enhancing people's abilities to design complicated and intricate objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the University of Washington I am focused on fabrication and simulation of mechanical metamaterials. My work
      spans planar materials as well as three dimensional stochastic foam-like materials. I apply mathematics, continuum mechanics, and
      physical simulation techniques to turn the intractable space of metamaterial design into an intutive and
      accessible design space.
